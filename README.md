# Data Analysis Project 1 - How have vehicles changed over the past 2.5 decades?
----------

## Background
----------
Our team was tasked with exploring a question of interest through detailed analysis. We ultimately decided to explore how cars have changed over time and through analyzing highway mpg, price, weight, and technology for three distinct body styles/types (cars, trucks, vans).

## Tools and Technology Used for Analysis
----------
* CSVs
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* VSCode
* Scipy
* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Slides

## Data Source

## How to Ingest the Completed Project
----------
1. Save the cleansed car data file ("car_data.csv") to a folder called "Clean_data"
2. Save the code in the "complete_data_analysis_code.ipynb" to an ".ipynb"
3. Create a blank folder called "output_images" for the output analysis charts
4. Run the code in jupyter notebook
5. You will now see the analysis in your jupyter notebook and the chart outputs in your "output_images" folder.
